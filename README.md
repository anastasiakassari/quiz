  Info: A website with a quiz using PHP. It uses 6 random questions from a MySQL database and counts the time and the right answers for every time a user plays.
  
  P.S.: If the user doesn't pick an answer (multiple choices) then it's considered as a wrong answer. (No default value for radio buttons)
